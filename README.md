# Fake-Product-Identification-System

***Abstract:***

      Risk factors like forging and duplication frequently accompany the global enhancement of a product or innovation. The reputation of the company and the well being of the customer can both be affected by forging. Nowadays, findingfake items is the biggest test. It is necessary to have a system for end user to check all details about product that they are buying so that the customer can check if the product is genuine or not. False goods have a serious negative effect on the organization and the clients' welfare. As a result, product makers are facing severe hardship. India and other countries are fighting against such phoney and counterfeit goods.  
      Blockchains can be used to find genuine items anddetect counterfeit products.Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralised, and digital ledger that maintains transactional information in the form of blocks in a network of database/nodes. Blockchain technology is safe because the data saved once in the chain is immutable, which means that no blockcan be modified or hacked. Customers or users do not need to rely on third-party users for certification of product authenticityand safety.
      In our project, the system generates QR (Quick Response) codes by employing custom Blockchain technology. Blocks are used to hold exchange records in this innovation. Data stored in these blocks cannot easily be accessed or changed. A counterfeit product can be identified using a QR code scanner, in which a product's QR code is linked to Blockchain. As a result, this system can be used to store product details and created unique codes for that product as database blocks. It compares the data in QR code with records in the database. If it matches, it means the product is real and genuine and we can display all the information related to the product; otherwise, product is counterfeit which will be notified to the end user. 
      

***How does this system work ?***

        The Manufacturers or corporate side application is the initial part of the website where they have to register. After logging onto the website and completing the registration procedure, we have a few options. One is to add a product and allow the creator fill in the details. Another option is to display the order so that they may see the details of the clients' orders. The manufacturer can also see whether or not the goods have been delivered. We can scan QR code using any scanner application or may create a option to upload QR code on this website and assess if it is fraudulent or legitimate. The customer logs in and fills out the essential information to order and book the product in our proposed system. The order of the product may be shown to the producer. When an order for a product is approved, the manufacturer generates the product's unique QR code.
        When a product order is saved on the network, a hash code is generated for that product, making it easier to track the transaction. In our system, a QR code is generated for each product order. Customers can upload the QR code on the website or can scan the QR code and can get the product details based on which customer can decide whether to buy the product or not by verifying the product details. If the QR code does not get scanned then the customer will get the related notification that the product is counterfeited.
